# GDownloader
   GDownloader is a desktop application to download audio and video with preferable quality from Youtube using ytdl-core. Most of the time we download songs and videos from youtube and transfer them to our computers might take time so i created this Desktop application compatible with all types of Operating Systems.
   Now you can play, download any songs and videos with selected Quality from your computer directly. Hope to help u saving time.
